To build: Nothing! Have python 2.7 installed.
I was using Python 2.7.3 while developing this.
To check your python version:
> python --version

Normally I'd put this code in python package so that tools
like pip can easily work with it. However, this code is so
small it's hard to justify the overhead and complexity and 
risk the inability to run it.

To Run the unit tests within the code:
> python -m unittest -v Word_Predictor

To Run the small manual testing mode (for custom testing)
> python Word_Predictor.py
